// Create a class named 'Member' having the following members:
// Data members

Now, assign name, age, phone number, address and salary to an employee and a manager by making an object of both of these classes and print the same.

public class Member{
    String name;
    int age;
    long contact;
    String address;
    int salary;
    
    public void printSalary(){
        System.out.println("The salary: " + salary);
